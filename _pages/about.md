👨‍🎓 I am a 3rd-year AI PhD student at [QuAIR Laboratory](https://xinwang.group/), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of Professor [Xin Wang](https://www.xinwang.info/). Before this, I received the B.S. and M.S. degree from the Univerisity of Melbourne in 2020 and 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Muhammad Usman](https://www.quantumelectronics.org/pi).

⚛️ My current research interests include Quantum Computer Architecture, Quantum Error Correction, and Quantum Machine learning.

✉️ **I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities.**

🗨️ **If you’d like to discuss research or potential collaborations, feel free to email me anytime.**

🧑‍🔬 **If you are interested in quantum computer architecture, you are welcome to apply for RA or PhD positions in our lab.**
